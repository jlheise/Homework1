* Being a data scientist being able to take data from collection to communication, ensuring the data environment is set up properly, managing the data itself, and producing models and analysis.
* Data scientists mainly focus on a problem and result while statisticians are mainly focused on modeling. They both work with modeling, but data scientists use models to try to solve a problem whereas statisticians use models to answer a scientific question.
* I think that I am somewhere in between. My background is as a fisheries biologist where data is used to understand the health of different populations, but all of the data collected must be managed and stored properly in order for it to be used. I think you need both for a project to be successful.

```{r}

y <- density(iris$Petal.Width)

#| echo: false

#determine class, type, and structure of the object y
class(y)
typeof(y)
str(y)

#use the plot function on y
plot(y)

```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
