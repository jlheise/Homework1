    "text": "Being a data scientist being able to take data from collection to communication, ensuring the data environment is set up properly, managing the data itself, and producing models and analysis.\nData scientists mainly focus on a problem and result while statisticians are mainly focused on modeling. They both work with modeling, but data scientists use models to try to solve a problem whereas statisticians use models to answer a scientific question.\nI think that I am somewhere in between. My background is as a fisheries biologist where data is used to understand the health of different populations, but all of the data collected must be managed and stored properly in order for it to be used. I think you need both for a project to be successful.\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\n#| echo: false\n\n#determine class, type, and structure of the object y\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n#use the plot function on y\nplot(y)"
